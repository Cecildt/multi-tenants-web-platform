# Deployment

## Overview

Cloudflare Workers is a serverless platform that enables developers to deploy code at the edge of Cloudflareâ€™s global network. This allows for low-latency execution of code, which is ideal for building serverless applications that require high performance.

## Deployment Process

1. **Install Wrangler**: Wrangler is a CLI tool that makes it easy to develop, build, and deploy Cloudflare Workers. You can install Wrangler using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
   ```

2. **Login to Cloudflare**: Before you can deploy a Worker, you need to login to your Cloudflare account using Wrangler:

   ```bash
    wrangler login
    ```
